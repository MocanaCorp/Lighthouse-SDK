# MocanaLighthouseSampleServer
This is a sample server that accepts client x509 certificates for user authentication. 
It's configured to accept certificates issued from a private Mocana CA, but you can feel free to use it
as you see fit (chaging the root certificate is easy). 
The server is written in Node.js and is set up to listen on port 443.
